# qr

Note : if you dont have python or library required for program (qr_app.py) dont use the (qr_app.py) and extract the rar files then use the (decode_qr.exe) this file.

in the standard way adter you generating a qr code anyone can see what is in inside that but when you use this script the generated qr qode have a 32 bit encryptation and after scaning with a normal scanner you just saw some wierd letter but when you scan the qr with this program you can see whats realey inside this.

first input field : this field is for pasting the encrypted text
start scan button : after clicking this button the camera app will start and you need to scan the qr code with your camera(after detecting qr automaticaly show you the decrypted text)
browse : select the qr file from your files
decrypt : if you using manual input or browse option after selecting file you should pres this button to show you the decrypted data in the last field

for generating qr press the generate button on the left
becuse of some problems the edit text box not good for editing your text please write in in other program like notepad and then copy it to your clipboard and paste it at the input and then press generate button after that a file having the qr code with name "encrypted_qr_code.png" will create on the directory you runned the program
